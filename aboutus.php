    <section>
        <p>Well, apart from giving me the opportunity to make a not so subtle, and completely
            irrelevant, reference to <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, its main purpose
            was to let me practice my jQuery skills.</p>
        <p>The over all design of the page is of no importance but since it would be a wasted opportunity
            to do otherwise, I've made an honest attempt to make it look appealing and also to try out some
            new design related features, as I do on just about all my demo pages. The background image comes from
            the excellent <a href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay.com.</a></p>
        <p>The jQuery features used in this demo are found under <em>Menus</em> and concern simple usage of the
        jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/slidedown/">slideDown</a>/<a href="http://api.jquery.com/slideup/"</a>slideUp methods.</p>

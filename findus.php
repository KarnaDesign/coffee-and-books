        <p>Since this is a demo page based only on a thought and a wish, there is no
        place like <em>Coffee & Books</em> to be found. At least not at this time.</p>
        <p>If there ever is such a place, I very much hope that they will ask me to fix them
        up with a place on the web.</p>
